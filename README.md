# Steps
1. Go to ``%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs`` and create a folder, you can name whatever you want. Im gonna name ``recipe_test`` for this tutorial.
2. Again go to ``%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs/recipe_test`` and create a file name ``manifest.json``.
3. Once you've done that, open the ``manifest.json`` file and paste the code from ``recipe_test>manifest.json`` (found in this repository) to **your** ``manifest.json``.
4. To add recipes, you must create a folder names ``recipes``, within the main folder, within that folder, the game uses ``.json`` to create recipes. 
5. There are many Crafting Style. 
# Shaped crafting
in a crafting table, there are two types of crafting, shaped and shapeless, we will begin with shaped.

In a shaped recipe, you have a specified pattern and a key of items like so, code found in ``recipe_test>recipes>.json`` in files (this repository)

# Shapeless Crafting
there is another type of crafting which is shapeless, the shapeless crafting has no pattern, but instead has a list and number of items for the craft, code found in ``recipe_test>recipes (2)>.json`` in files (this repository)
