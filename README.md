# Custom-Minecraft-Recipe
This repository will help you in creating custom recipe for crafting in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
# What is Minecraft Recipe?
The recipe book can be displayed in inventory, crafting table, furnace, blast furnace and smoker. The player must enter the GUI and press the knowledge book icon; the recipe book then opens to the left. Recipes are stored in several different tabs: Crafting Table and Inventory.

# Steps 
1. Go to ``%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs``` and create a folder, you can name whatever you want. Im gonna name ``recipe_test`` for this tutorial.
2. Again go to ``%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs/recipe_test`` and create a file name ``manifest.json``.
3. Once you've done that, open the ``manifest.json`` file and paste this code 

{

    "format_version": 2,

    "header": {

        "description": "Example vanilla behavior pack",

        "name": "Vanilla Behavior Pack",

        "uuid": "ee649bcf-256c-4013-9068-6a802b89d756",

        "version": [ 0, 0, 1 ],

        "min_engine_version": [ 1, 16, 220 ]

    },

    "modules": [

        {

            "description": "Example vanilla behavior pack",

            "type": "data",

            "uuid": "fa6e90c8-c925-460f-8155-c8a60b753caa",

            "version": [0, 0, 1]

        }

    ],

    "dependencies": [

        {

            "uuid": "66c6e9a8-3093-462a-9c36-dbb052165822",

            "version": [0, 0, 1]

        }

    ]

}
4. To add recipes, you must create a folder names ``recipes`` within the main folder. within that folder, the game uses ``.json`` to create recipes. 
5. There are many Crafting Style. (Shaped Crafting and Shaoeless Crafting).
